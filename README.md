## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage 

### Prerequisites  
- A C compiler (`gcc` or `clang`)  
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (for building the experiments)  

### Steps to Build and Run  

1. Clone the repository:  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ajasdaison/System-Software-Lab.git
    cd System-Software-Lab
    ```
2. Create a build directory and configure with CMake:
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    ```
3. Build the experiments:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
4. Run a specific experiment (example for exp1):
    ```bash
    ./exp1/exp1_executable
    ```
